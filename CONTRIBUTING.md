# CONTRIBUTING
To contribute, create a new folder for each problem (if it doesn't exist) and work on your code there. Ex: Problem_1's solution should be in the same directory as the question.
PR's will not be accepted otherwise. Make sure your GitHub username is at the top of your code in a comment.
Keep the code clean, simple and well commented so that anyone in the future can understand easily. Any of these languages are
fine:
> C (`GNU GCC 6+`), C++ (`GNU GCC 6+`), Java (`Java SE 8+`), Python (`Python 3.6.5+`)

If you want to use another language, create a new issue and a maintainer will respond.
